            <p id="about-paragraph">Hi! My name is Spencer Keen, and I'm currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Software Engineering and Design. For some of my hobbies, I like to play in the university marching band and participate in intramural sports, such as ultimate frisbee, volleyball, and flag football. As for my future, I'm doing an internship this summer with Walmart, and I want to go into Software Engineering!</p>
